  This year I spent my birthday in Baltimore and I would have NEVER seen this coming. It all started the afternoon the day before, May 22nd, my boyfriend Baxter and I went to a meeting for a comedy show he was co-hosting to plan the next event. One of the people we were going to meet with was an ex-roommate of ours who is a professional photographer. The organizers of the event chatted and went through the ups and downs of the previous show and began to hash out a few out the bits for the upcoming show. A few hours went by and it was over.

  <br><br>We all exited into the elevator when our ex-roommate looked over at my boyfriend and asks. “Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? I need an assistant for a shoot in Baltimore tomorrow.” My boyfriend, almost completely forgetting that it’s my birthday stops to ponder when it hits him, “It’s actually Amber’s birthday tomorrow…”. Our ex-roommate laughs and directs his next question at both of us, “So, what are you both doing tomorrow then? Wanna come to Baltimore?”. Now, I didn’t know anything about Baltimore, and honestly to this day I still don’t but we went along with the spontaneous plans and agreed to meet tomorrow, the morning of my birthday at 8AM in the Bronx.

  <br><br>Fast forward to the morning of the trip: I am not a morning person and I wasn’t entirely thrilled about spending my birthday in Baltimore but up until that point I didn’t have any birthday plans. However, when I arrived in Baltimore I did a ton of fun things. Here are a few photos taken that day...

<p>I really enjoy the look of the nav bar on the site and the placement of the social media buttons at the top. Upon first glance I thought the site had a good layout that showcased the site's content well. After scrolling down and spending more time on the site, I noticed that there are 6 different types of links to the blog owner's social media and I felt that was a bit much. I also feel that the homepage itself contains A LOT of information, almost too much that could've been separated into nav items. </p>
